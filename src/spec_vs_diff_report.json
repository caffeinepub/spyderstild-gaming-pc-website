  "summary": "The implementation successfully delivers all five requirements for the Spyderstild gaming peripheral showcase website. The diff shows a complete React/TypeScript/Tailwind CSS frontend with dark theme, neon accents (green/cyan/orange - avoiding blue/purple), sharp geometric design elements, product category sections with cards, navigation header with branding, and proper component structure. However, REQ-5 regarding generated images is only partially addressed - while the code references the required image paths in frontend/public/assets/generated, the actual image files are not present in the diff (no files added to that directory).",

      "requirement": "Generate rendered images of the generated hero background, product category banners, and Spyderstild logo as static assets in frontend/public/assets/generated",
      "reason": "The code references image paths (hero-background.dim_1920x1080.png, spyderstild-logo.dim_400x120.png, mice-banner.dim_800x400.png, keyboard-banner.dim_800x400.png, monitor-banner.dim_800x400.png) in the correct directory structure, but no actual image files were added to frontend/public/assets/generated in the diff. The acceptance criteria require images to be saved to this directory and render correctly in the UI, but without the files, they cannot render.",
